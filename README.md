# VTOL-Tiltrotor
This project focuses on the conceptualization, design, and prototyping of an electric-powered Tilt-Rotor VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. The primary objective is to develop a lightweight, low-cost UAV capable of transitioning between vertical lift and horizontal forward flight using tilt-rotor actuation and remote control.

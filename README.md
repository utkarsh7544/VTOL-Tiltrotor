# VTOL-Tiltrotor
A Twin Rotor UAV utilizing Tiltrotor mechanism to achieve VTOL.

# Overview
This project focuses on the conceptualization, design, and prototyping of an electric-powered Tilt-Rotor VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft. The primary objective is to develop a lightweight, low-cost UAV capable of transitioning between vertical lift and horizontal forward flight using tilt-rotor actuation and remote control. The tiltineg mechanism has been devised using a 1:2 spur gear system, with 90-degree range of motion and an sg90 on each wing. Wings were made using NACA 6409 airfoil. The fuselage, gears, ribs of the wing and tilting components were fabricated by 3d printed ABS. Carbon tubes were used to makes spars and tail. Empennage was made using corrugated plastic sheet. The system sustained 2kg of maximum thrust at 700g of mass, and 90cm wingspan, proving design viability.

# Componets Used
-> A triplet of sg90 servo motors, 2 of them were used to actuate tiltoror mechanism on each wing and the third one was used to actuate the elevator. <br>
-> 4500 mah 3S battery was used to power the system.<br>
-> A pair of 1000kv BLDC motors.<br>
-> A pair of 1045 wings.<br>
-> FlySky FS-i6 2.4G 6CH PPM RC Transmitter.<br>
-> FLY SKY FS IA6B RF 2.4GHz 6CH receiver.<br>
